Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets added:

```typescript
// ... [previous code remains the same until the end]

  return {
    gameState,
    isLoading,
    equipWeapon,
    equipArmor,
    upgradeWeapon,
    upgradeArmor,
    sellWeapon,
    sellArmor,
    openChest,
    purchaseMythical,
    startCombat,
    attack,
    resetGame,
    setGameMode,
    toggleCheat,
    generateCheatItem,
    mineGem,
    exchangeShinyGems,
    discardItem,
    purchaseRelic,
    upgradeRelic,
    equipRelic,
    unequipRelic,
    sellRelic,
    claimDailyReward,
    upgradeSkill,
    prestige,
    claimOfflineRewards,
    bulkSell,
    bulkUpgrade,
    plantSeed,
    buyWater,
    updateSettings,
    addCoins,
    addGems,
    teleportToZone,
    setExperience,
    rollSkill,
    selectAdventureSkill,
    skipAdventureSkills,
    useSkipCard,
  };
};

export default useGameState;
```

The main issue was that the file was missing its final closing brackets. I've added them to properly close:

1. The return object
2. The useGameState hook function
3. The export statement

The rest of the code structure appears correct, with all other brackets properly matched throughout the file.
